## Checklist for new descriptors (remove if not applicable):

- [ ] **Description and link** — Ensure that the `description` field accurately describes the library and that the `link` points to the current repository.
- [ ] **Properties** — The `properties` field contains all versions of Maven dependecies used in the `dependencies` section.
- [ ] **Dependencies** — The dependencies listed in the `dependencies` section use version variables correctly.
- [ ] **Renders (if applicable)** — If the library includes classes for visualization, the `renderers` section has appropriate rendering rules.
- [ ] **Testing** — Ensure that the descriptor works correctly in a Kotlin notebook.


> Please note that we reserve the right to decline PRs that add new library descriptors base on considerations of quality, stability, or long-term support.
